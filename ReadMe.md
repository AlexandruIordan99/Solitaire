This project creates a solitaire game as a way of practicing Java some more and learning about creating a relatively complex GUI (at least compared to a weather app). 
Some of the code is extremely messy and the +100 to card grabbing calculations works as 'magic number' type of fix. Despite this, a player should have little issue finishing a game.
